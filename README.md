- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LMKraft
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently mostly working with Jahia

<p>
	I created this repository to share some usefull samples of Jahia 8 code.<br />
	Those samples are based on Jahia 8.1.1.0 Enterprise Demo Package.

	Feel free to reuse it or comment anything you can find interesting... or bad !

	Working in IT since 2015, my GitHub Repo is brand new, and I juste started this personnal project.<br />
	As I am French, I may make some mistakes, but will try to do everything in English for it to be accessible for most of you.
